Frescas y Fierce Podcast
# project overview
Podcast was created to dedicate a space where Latinas can feel safe from judgment and empowered. We dive into a variety of topics, from career advice and personal development to cultural identity and social justice. These conversations are aimed to uplift and inspire women so they may reach their full potential.
Simultaneously, this helps aspiring podcasters and content creators gain comprehension into the necessary tools that will help analyze podcast performance and audience insights. For example, using platforms that integrate AI powered audio, video, and audience analysis will facilitate their content and allow them to make better data-driven decisions.
# problem statement
Podcasters often struggle to measure the impact of their content and engage with their audience effectively. Existing tools are limited in scope and often require manual analysis. This project aims to address this gap by providing an automated solution.
